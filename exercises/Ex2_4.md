# Exercise 2.4

4.  Why can’t you implement a Java method that swaps the contents of two int variables?
    Instead, write a method that swaps the contents of two IntHolder objects.
    (Look up this rather obscure class in the API documentation.)
    Can you swap the contents of two Integer objects?

You can’t "swap the contents" of two integer variables as `int` is a primitive type,
not a reference type.

I can’t seem to import `IntHolder` as it lives in `org.omg.CORBA` but going by
[the online documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/org/omg/CORBA/IntHolder.html)
such a method might look like this:

```java
    void swapIntHolderValues(IntHolder a, IntHolder b) {
        int temp = a.value;
        a.value = b.value;
        b.value = temp;
    }
```

It doesn’t appear that you can do something similar for `Integer` objects as they
are immutable (hiding their state — the integer value they box).
