/*
Compared to the Stack class in this package, this uses a plain Object[]
to store the data, and performs the cast when retrieving elements from
the array on pop().

I much prefer the casting of the array to E[] in Stack over this approach
as it keeps the cast at the original assignment (where it is assigned
with a default value), and it never has to be considered again.

I donâ€™t like pushing the cast into the method, as my feeling is that
it would be easier to introduce a bug if pop() were ever refactored
(hypothetical).
