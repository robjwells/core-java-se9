# Exercise 5.12

> Compare the use of Objects.requireNonNull(obj) and assert obj != null. Give a compelling use for each.

The main difference is that unless `java` is invoked with `-ea` then the assertions in your program are *disabled*.
Therefore this is not something that you can always rely on to (in this instance) catch `null` values.
This may be what you want – eg in development and testing.

`Objects.requireNonNull` does not depend on being enabled in this way and so is reliable in that sense.
It also offers ergonomic alternatives to provide a default value — including a lazily-computed one —
when the value is `null`, rather than just raising an `AssertionError`.
