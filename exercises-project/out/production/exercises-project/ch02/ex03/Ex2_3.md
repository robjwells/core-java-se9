# Exercise 2.3

3.  Can you ever have a mutator method return something other than void?
    Can you ever have an accessor method return void?
    Give examples when possible.

A mutator might update the internal state of an object and, say, return the new state.

An accessor method, defined as broadly as it is in the book, might cause some side
effect (eg `showSummary()` may not change the internal state of an object but just
perform a print operation).

I donâ€™t know the Java API well enough to give real examples.
